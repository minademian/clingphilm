# Clingphilm (alpha)
Clingphilm is a tool to protect photos without JavaScript, third-party plugins, or browser extentions.

It relies on CSS to overlay buttons on top of images so that the images cannot be saved by right-click > save.

The tool doesn't stop taking screenshots or dragging image to desktop.

I'm looking for input on how to take this project to the next level.
